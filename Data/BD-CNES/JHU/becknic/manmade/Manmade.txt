MANMADE MATERIAL SPECTRA

Spectra of manmade materials were extracted by permission from the 
Nonconventional Exploitation Factors (NEF) database.  This database of spectral 
signatures of manmade materials was produced by carefully calibrated 
directional hemispherical reflectance measurements for the National 
Photographic Interpretation Center.  This database also contains the BRDF of 
samples, as well as the thermal and radio frequency properties, which are not 
presented here.
