THE JPL SPECTRAL LIBRARY 

The JPL spectral library was originally published in Laboratory Reflectance Spectra of
160 Minerals, 0.4 to 2.5 Micrometers, by C.I. Grove, S.J. Hook, and E.D. Paylor II. The
following description of the library and the preparation and measurement of the samples it
contains is taken from that report. The report refers to the measurements made with the
Beckman spectrometer. The same sample preparation and measurement procedure was used with
the Nicolet spectrometer.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 

This JPL Spectral Library includes laboratory reflectance spectra of 160 minerals in
digital form. No attempt has been made to investigate the causes of the spectral features
observed. Excellent theoretical studies dealing with the causes of these features are
available in the open literature. One of the most comprehensive studies was published by
Hunt and his coworkers in a series of papers between 1970 and 1979. Since then, several
catalogues of reflectance spectra have been published, including Clark et al., 1990; Lang
et al., 1990; and Urai et al., 1989. 

Data for 135 of the minerals are presented at three different grain sizes: 125-500µm,
45-125µm, and &lt;45µm. This study was undertaken to illustrate the effect of particle
size on the shape of the mineral spectra. Ancillary information is provided with each
mineral spectrum, including the mineral name, mineralogy, supplier, sampling locality, and
our designated sample number. Generalized chemical formulae were obtained from Fleischer
(1983) or electron microprobe analysis, when available. The purity of each mineral sample
was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and identifiable accessory minerals, if present,
are noted with the ancillary information. 

In the original publication the spectra were separated into classes according to the
dominant anion or anionic group present, which is the classification scheme traditionally
used in mineralogy. This format has been followed with the organization of the ftp site
and each mineral class is a separate subdirectory. Classes include arsenates, borates,
carbonates, elements, halides, hydroxides, oxides, phosphates, silicates, sulphates,
sulphides and tungstates. The silicate class has been subdivided further into subclasses
based on the degree of polymerization of the silicon tetrahedra. These subclasses include
cyclosilicates, inosilicates, nesosilicates, phyllosilicates, sorosilicates and
tectosilicates. 



2.0 METHODOLOGY 

2.1 Sample Origin 

The majority of non-clay minerals used in this report were obtained from Ward's Natural
Science Establishment, Rochester, New York; the Burnham Mineral Company (Burminco),
Monrovia, California; or from an in-house collection. Most of the clay minerals were
obtained from the Source Clay Mineral Repository, University of Missouri, Columbia,
Missouri. In all cases, the supplier of the sample is listed in the ancillary information
describing each sample. 

It was not possible to obtain sufficiently large quantities of all natural minerals,
particularly oxides and some clays. In these cases, synthetic minerals were used. In all
cases, XRD data for the synthetic mineral agreed with the data reported for the natural
mineral in the Mineral Powder Diffraction File Data Book (Joint Committee Powder
Diffraction Standards, 1980). 



2.2 Sample Preparation 

Mineral samples were pulverized with a steel percussion mortar. A magnet was used to
remove metallic impurities introduced during this procedure. The pulverized sample was
then ground with mortar and pestle and separated into different size fractions by
wet-sieving with distilled water or 2-propanol (for water-soluble minerals) in nested
sieves. The size fractions selected for reflectance measurements were 125-500µm,
45-125µm, and &lt;45µm, which correspond to fine-to-medium sand, coarse silt to very
fine sand, and medium silt to clay, respectively. In certain instances, only one grain
size was analyzed due to the nature and/or paucity of the sample (e.g., cristobalite, clay
minerals).



2.3 X-ray Diffraction 

The purity of each mineral sample was evaluated by using standard XRD methods described
in Klug and Alexander (1954). A Norelco water-cooled X-ray diffractometer, equipped with a
vertical scan goniometer and focusing monochromater was used for the analysis. All samples
were analyzed by Ni-filtered, CuK radiation. Diffraction lines were recorded on a strip
chart recorder at a scan rate of 1o (2 ) per minute over the angular range of 4o to 65o (2
). 

The Mineral Powder Diffraction File Search Manual and Data Book (Joint Committee on
Powder Diffraction Standards, 1980) was used to identify crystalline phases. Additional
XRD data were obtained from Borg and Smith (1969) and Berry and Thompson (1962).
Identification of clay mineral phases was facilitated by techniques and diffraction data
presented by Carroll (1970) and Brindley and Brown (1980). 

The XRD criteria used to determine the purity of our samples were based on the number
and intensity of diagnostic peaks. If impurities were identified in a sample, a
semiquantitative estimate of their abundance was made by XRD. Several limitations of XRD
analysis are applicable to our results. Many crystalline substances are strong diffractors
of X-rays and can be detected when present in concentrations as small as 1-2 percent.
Other materials diffract X-rays less efficiently and yield diffraction patterns of
measurable intensity only when they constitute a major portion of the sample. As a result,
certain minor constituents cannot be identified by XRD alone. For example, many of the
feldspars have suffered minor incipient alteration, which manifests as small features in
the Beckman spectra (for example, the sharp feature around 2.2µm in Sanidine TS-14A). No
alteration products were identified by XRD in the Sanidine sample. The problems associated
with the detection limits of XRD analyses are discussed in detail in Klug and Alexander
(1954). 



2.4 Electron Microprobe 

Chemical composition data were acquired by electron microprobe analysis for some of our
minerals known to deviate significantly from idealized end-member compositions. These
analyses were undertaken with the Cameca CAMEBAX electron microprobe at U.C.L.A. Chemical
compositions were obtained from polished grain mounts in the wavelength dispersive mode by
using 15 keV accelerating potential, 1.5 nAo absorbed current and 20s counting intervals.
Compositionally well-characterized silicate minerals from the U.C.L.A. collection were
employed as standards. Raw data were reduced according to the ZAF correction scheme (Henog
et al., 1982). Results for major elements are believed to be accurate to ±1%.
Quantitative chemical compositions presented for minerals in Appendix B represent the
average of three or more individual analyses and are indicated by an asterisk (*)
following the chemical formula.



2.5 Spectrophotometer 

Hemispherical reflectance measurements in the visible and short-wavelength region of
the electromagnetic spectrum (0.4 to 2.5µm) were made by using a Beckman UV5240
spectrophotometer (Price, 1977). The Beckman UV5240 incorporates a single-pass
monochromator and utilizes a diffraction grating as its dispersing element. The sampling
interval is .001µm, from 0.4 to 0.8µm, and .004µm, from 0.8 to 2.5µm. Our instrument
has been modified with an integrating sphere rotated 90 degrees, which facilitates
measurement of powdered samples and soils by allowing the materials to remain in the
sample holder in a horizontal position. 

For reflectance measurements, the size-sorted samples were poured into aluminum sample
holders that measured 3.2 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in depth. The upper surface was
carefully smoothed with the edge of a stainless steel spatula. Smoothing with a spatula
may compact the sample and introduce some preferred orientation of grains. However, every
effort was made to minimize these effects. The sample was then placed in the sample
compartment where it and a Halon reference standard were illuminated alternately by
monochromatic radiation from a high-intensity halogen source lamp. Halon, a trade name for
polytetrafluoroethylene powder, has been shown to be a good diffuser of incident radiation
over the spectral range of the 0.2 - 2.5 m region (Weidner and Hsia, 1981). However, Halon
does have a small absorption feature near 2.2µm. This feature is manifest in spectra with
a high reflectance in the 2.0 - 2.5µm region. In order to correct this Halon artifact,
the spectra were multiplied by the reflectance of Halon vs a perfect diffuser given in
Weidner and Hsia (1981). The correction largely removed the influence of the Halon
absorption feature in our spectra.
